      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I work at a small engineering company in San Francisco that specializes in high speed and high precision technology products. I oversee all of our operations, but I am not an engineer myself. I hope that this course will be an introduction into better understanding/communicating about some of the tools that our engineers rely on.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>San Francisco, CA</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Spoiling my dog, golfing with my husband, hanging out with friends, spending time in Tahoe and Santa Barbara, and traveling abroad.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>The job I have now, with half the hours.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>San Francisco, CA</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I run a small company that relies too heavily on paper and inefficient systems. Among other things, I'd like to update our company website, and start to familiarize myself with tools and ideas that could help us transform our data structures, interfaces, and operations.</p>
